What I Learned Today:

HTML: Structure of a webpage, creating sections like Home, About, Services, Portfolio, Contact.
CSS: Styling elements, making the layout attractive, using flexbox for alignment.
JavaScript: Adding dark mode toggle (ðŸŒ™), and improving form validation.

What I Implemented:

âœ… Navigation Bar â€“ Added smooth scrolling and section links.
âœ… Hero Section â€“ Created a welcoming intro with a "Hire Me" button.
âœ… Services & Portfolio â€“ Displayed skills and projects in a grid layout.
âœ… Contact Form â€“ Included basic form inputs for user messages.
âœ… Dark Mode Toggle â€“ Implemented a button to switch themes.

Challenges I Faced:

Aligning elements properly using flexbox â€“ Needed practice with display: flex; and justify-content.
Styling the Hero Section â€“ Making text and buttons visually appealing.
JavaScript form validation â€“ Handling empty inputs and incorrect email formats.
Dark Mode Issues â€“ Ensuring all elements change color smoothly.
